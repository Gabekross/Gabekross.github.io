            <h1>Iceland</h1>
            <p><strong>Iceland</strong> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and 
            ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by summer's midight sun. A country where insular exitence has spurred a rich and vibran culture

                        The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. 
                        From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred 
                        to as the Northern Lights, is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere 
                        in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

                        When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake—namely, its 4,500 square 
                        miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and 
                        Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).

            <p><strong>Hollywood Reporter and Screen Daily give Icelandic director Elfar Adalsteins great reviews</strong><br>
                <em>End of Sentence</em>, by director Elfar Adalsteins, receives very positive reviews in leading film industry magazines such as 
                Hollywood. The film’s two leading actors, John Hawkes and Logan Lerman, are also praised in both reviews. Hawkes has quite a few 
                films under his belt and was nominated for an Oscar for <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, and young Lerman is best known for his role in 
                <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em>. Icelandic actor Olafur Darri Olafsson also has a small part in <em>End of Sentence</em>.
