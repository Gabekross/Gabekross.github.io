                            when charged particles from the

                    <p><strong><em>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</em></strong>, 
                        or northern lights, begin high in the Earth’s
                        atmosphere—at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged 
                        particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field.

                <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. 
                Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you’d like to take in these light shows yourself. 
                For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution.
                Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA <a href="https://www.noaa.gov" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                 <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night.
                     Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. 
                     Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth’s magnetic field 
                     lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating 
                     aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, 
                     when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes.
